Here provide the simple interface (C/C++) of redis API: hash and list.
Common operation are defined in wredis.h
However, it is a good idea to use redishash or redislist(which derived from wredis).

If you use linux, you can type the following command to compile the code:

    cd redis
    make
    ./a.out
